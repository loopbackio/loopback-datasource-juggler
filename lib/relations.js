/**
 * Declare "belongsTo" relation that sets up a one-to-one connection with another model, such that each
 * instance of the declaring model "belongs to" one instance of the other model.
 *
 * For example, if an application includes users and posts, and each post can be written by exactly one user.
 * The following code specifies that `Post` has a reference called `author` to the `User` model via the `userId` property of `Post`
 * as the foreign key.
 * ```
 * Post.belongsTo(User, {as: 'author', foreignKey: 'userId'});
 * ```
 * You can then access the author in one of the following styles.
 * Get the User object for the post author asynchronously:
 * ```
 * post.author(callback);
 * ```
 * Get the User object for the post author synchronously:
 * ```
 * post.author();
 * ```
 * Set the author to be the given user:
 * ```
 * post.author(user) 
 * ```
 * Examples:
 * 
 * Suppose the model Post has a *belongsTo* relationship with User (the author of the post). You could declare it this way:
 * ```js
 * Post.belongsTo(User, {as: 'author', foreignKey: 'userId'});
 * ```
 *
 * When a post is loaded, you can load the related author with:
 * ```js
 * post.author(function(err, user) {
 *     // the user variable is your user object
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The related object is cached, so if later you try to get again the author, no additional request will be made.
 * But there is an optional boolean parameter in first position that set whether or not you want to reload the cache:
 * ```js
 * post.author(true, function(err, user) {
 *     // The user is reloaded, even if it was already cached.
 * });
 * ```
 * This optional parameter default value is false, so the related object will be loaded from cache if available.
 *
 * @param {Class|String} modelTo Model object (or String name of model) to which you are creating the relationship.
 * @options {Object} params Configuration parameters; see below.
 * @property {String} as Name of the property in the referring model that corresponds to the foreign key field in the related model.
 * @property {String} foreignKey Name of foreign key property.

 * ```
 *  User.hasAndBelongsToMany('groups', {model: Group, foreignKey: 'groupId'});
